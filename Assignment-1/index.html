        in other media
      </li>
      <li>

        <span class="bg-text">CSS saves a lot of work.</span> It can control the
        layout of multiple webpage all at once.

    <h2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>

    <ul class="unordered-list">
      <li>Inline- by using the style attribute inside HTML elements.</li>
      <li>Internal- by using a style tag in the head section.</li>
      <li>
        External- by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.
      </li>
      <li>
        This most common way to add CSS. is to keep the styles in external CSS
        fiels. however,
        <span>in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span>
        because this is easier to demonstrate,and easier for you to try it
        yourself.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="compare-text">
      When comparing CSS class vs ID,the difference is that CSS class applies a
      style to multiple elements.ID, on the other hand,applies a style to one
      unique element.ID is also special in that you can use a special URL. to
      link directly to an element and it's used by Javascript.
    </p>

    <p class="secondLast-text">
      In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of
      elements on a webpage. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set
      of styles can be applied to the elements.
    </p>

    <p class="last-text">
      There is a wide range of selectors avialable.Two of the most commonly used
      are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should
      be applied
